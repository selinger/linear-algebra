\end{outcome}

We have taken an in-depth look at graphical representations of systems
of equations, as well as how to find possible solutions
graphically. Our attention now turns to working with systems
algebraically.

\begin{definition}{Linear equation}{linear-equation}
  A \textbf{linear equation}%
  \index{linear equation} is an equation of the form
  \begin{equation*}
    a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + \ldots + a_nx_n = b.
  \end{equation*}
  Here, $a_1,\ldots,a_n$ are real numbers called the
  \textbf{coefficients}%
  \index{coefficient} of the equation, $b$ is a real number called the
  \textbf{constant term}%
  \index{constant term} of the equation, and $x_1,\ldots,x_n$ are
  \textbf{variables}%
  \index{variable}.
\end{definition}

Real numbers, such as the coefficients $a_1,\ldots,a_n$, the constant
term $b$, or the values of the variables $x_1,\ldots,x_n$, will also
be called \textbf{scalars}%
\index{scalar}. For now, the word ``scalar'' is just a synonym for
``real number''. Later, in Section~\ref{sec:fields}, we will discover
other kinds of scalars.

\begin{example}{Linear vs. non-linear equation}{linear-vs-non-linear}
  Which of the following equations are linear?
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{array}{c}
      2x+3y=5 \\
      2x^2+3y=5 \\
      2\sqrt{x} + 3y = 5 \\
      (\sqrt{2}) x + 3y = 5^2
    \end{array}
  \end{equation*}
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
  The equation $2x+3y=5$ is linear. The equation $2x^2+3y=5$ is not
  linear, because it contains the square of a variable instead of a
  variable.  The equation $2\sqrt{x} + 3y = 5$ is also not linear,
  because the square root is applied to one of the variables. On the
  other hand, the equation $(\sqrt{2}) x + 3y = 5^2$ is linear,
  because $\sqrt{2}$ and $5^2$ are real numbers, and can
  therefore be used as coefficients and constant terms.
\end{solution}

We also permit minor notational variants of linear equations. The
equation $2x-3y=5$ is linear although
Definition~\ref{def:linear-equation} does not mention subtraction,
because it can be regarded as just another notation for
$2x+(-3)y = 5$. Similarly, the equation $2x=5+3y$ can be regarded as
linear, because it can be easily rewritten as $2x-3y=5$ by bringing
all the variables (and their coefficients) to the left-hand side.
When we need to emphasize that some linear equation is literally of
the form $a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + \ldots + a_nx_n = b$, we say that the
equation is in \textbf{standard form}%
\index{linear equation!standard form}%
\index{standard form!of a linear equation}. Thus, the standard form of
the equation $2x=5+3y$ is $2x+(-3)y=5$.

A \textbf{solution}%
\index{linear equation!solution} to a linear equation is an assignment
of real numbers to the variables, making the equation true. More
precisely, if $r_1,\ldots,r_n$ are real numbers, the assignment
$x_1=r_1$, \ldots, $x_n=r_n$ is a solution to the equation in
Definition~\ref{def:linear-equation} if the real number
$a_1r_1 + a_2r_2 + \ldots + a_nr_n$ is equal to the real number
$b$. To save space, we often write solutions in \textbf{tuple
  notation}%
\index{tuple}\footnote{The terminology ``tuple'' arose as follows. A
  collection of two items is called a ``pair'', a collection of three
  items is called a ``triple'', followed by ``quadruple'',
  ``quintuple'', ``sextuple'', and so on. You have to know Latin to
  know what the next ones are called. To avoid these Latin terms,
  mathematicians started saying $4$-tuple, $5$-tuple, $6$-tuple and so
  on, and more generally, $n$-tuple for an ordered collection of $n$
  items. When $n$ doesn't matter or is clear from the context, we
  often just say ``tuple''.}  as
$(x_1,\ldots,x_n) = (r_1,\ldots,r_n)$. When there is no doubt about
the order of the variables, we also often simply write the solution as
$(r_1,\ldots,r_n)$.

\begin{example}{Solutions of a linear equation}{linear-equation-solutions}
  Consider the linear equation $2x+3y-4z=5$. Which of the following
  are solutions? (a) $(x,y,z)=(1,1,0)$, (b) $(x,y,z)=(0,3,1)$, (c)
  $(x,y,z)=(1,1,1)$.
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
  The assignment $(x,y,z) = (1,1,0)$ is a solution because
  $2(1)+3(1)-4(0) = 5$. The assignment $(x,y,z) = (0,3,1)$ is also a
  solution, because $2(0) + 3(3) - 4(1) = 5$. On the other hand,
  $(x,y,z) = (1,1,1)$ is not a solution, because
  $2(1) + 3(1)-4(1) = 1 \neq 5$.
\end{solution}

A system of linear equations is just several linear equations taken
together.

\begin{definition}{System of linear equations}{system-of-linear-equations}
  A \textbf{system of linear equations}%
  \index{system of linear equations} is a list of equations
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{array}{c@{~}c@{~}c}
      a_{11}x_1+a_{12}x_2+\ldots+a_{1n}x_n&=&b_1 \\
      a_{21}x_1+a_{22}x_2+\ldots+a_{2n}x_n&=&b_2 \\
      \vdots \\
      a_{m1}x_1+a_{m2}x_2+\ldots+a_{mn}x_n&=&b_m,
    \end{array}
  \end{equation*}
  where $a_{ij}$ and $b_i$ are scalars (i.e., real numbers). The above
  is a system of $m$ equations in the $n$ variables
  $x_1,x_2\ldots,x_n$.  As before, the numbers $a_{ij}$ are called the
  \textbf{coefficients}%
  \index{coefficient} and the numbers $b_i$ are called the
  \textbf{constant terms}%
  \index{constant term} of the system of equations.
\end{definition}

The relative size of $m$ and $n$ is not important here. We may have
more variables than equations, more equations than variables, or an
equal number of equations and variables.

A \textbf{solution}%
\index{system of linear equations!solution} to a system of linear
equations is an assignment of real numbers to the variables that is a
solution to {\em all} of the equations in the system.

\begin{example}{Solutions of a system of linear equations}{linear-system-solutions}
  Consider the system of linear equations
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{array}{c@{~}c@{~}c@{~}c@{~}c@{~}c@{~}c}
      2x&+&3y&-&4z &=& 5 \\
      -2x&+&y&+&2z &=& -1.
    \end{array}
  \end{equation*}
  Which of the following are solutions of the system? (a)
  $(x,y,z)=(1,1,0)$, (b) $(x,y,z)=(6,3,4)$, (c) $(x,y,z)=(0,3,1)$.
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
  The assignment $(x,y,z)=(1,1,0)$ is a solution of this system of
  equations, because it is a solution to the first equation and the
  second equation. Also, $(x,y,z)=(6,3,4)$ is another solution of this
  system of equations (check this!).  On the other hand,
  $(x,y,z)=(0,3,1)$ is not a solution of the system, because although
  it is a solution to the first equation, it is not a solution to the
  second equation.
\end{solution}

Recall from Section~\ref{sec:systems-geometric} that a system of
equations either has a unique solution, infinitely many solutions, or
no solution. It is very important to us whether a system of equations
has solutions or not. For this reason, we introduce the following
terminology:

\begin{definition}{Consistent and inconsistent systems}{consistent-and-inconsistent}
  A system of linear equations is called \textbf{consistent}%
  \index{consistent system}%
  \index{system of linear equations!consistent} if there exists at
  least one solution. It is called \textbf{inconsistent}%
  \index{inconsistent system}%
  \index{system of linear equations!inconsistent} if there is no
  solution.
\end{definition}

If we think of each equation as a condition that must be satisfied by
the variables, consistent means that there is some choice of values
for the variables which can satisfy \textbf{all} of the
conditions. Inconsistent means that there is no such choice of values
for the variables. In the following sections, you will learn a method
for determining whether a system of equations is consistent or not,
and in case it is consistent, to find all of its solutions.
