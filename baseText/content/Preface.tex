\textit{\bookfulltitle} is an introduction to linear algebra for
students in the first or second year of university. The book contains
enough material for a 2-semester course. Major topics of linear
algebra are presented in detail, and many applications are
given. Although it is not a proof-oriented book, proofs of most
important theorems are provided. 

Each section begins with a list of desired outcomes which a student
should be able to achieve upon completing the chapter.  Throughout the
text, examples and diagrams are given to reinforce ideas and provide
guidance on how to approach various problems. Students are encouraged
to work through the suggested exercises provided at the end of each
section. Selected solutions to these exercises are given at the end of
the text.
