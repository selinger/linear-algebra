\section{Gauss-Jordan elimination}

\begin{outcome}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Find the {\rref} of a matrix.
  \item Solve a system of linear equations using Gauss-Jordan elimination.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{outcome}

In the previous section, we saw how to solve a system of equations by
using Gaussian elimination and back substitution. The back
substitution step can be quite confusing and error prone, especially
when there are parameters. For example, in
Example~\ref{exa:two-parameter-set-of-solution}, we had to substitute $y=s$,
$z=2-t$, and $w=t$ into the equation $x=3-2y+2z-2w$, which required
another simplification step.

In this section, you will learn an alternative procedure called {\em
  Gauss-Jordan elimination} which eliminates the need for back
substitution, at the expense of doing a few additional row operations.
The key to this technique is a special kind of {\ef} called a
{\em {\rref}}.

\begin{definition}{\Rref}{rref}
  An augmented matrix is in \textbf{\rref}%
  \eindex{\rref}%
  \eindex{\ef!reduced} if

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item It is in {\ef}.

  \item Each leading entry is equal to $1$.

  \item All entries above a leading entry are zero.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{example}{{\Rref}}{rref-matrices}
  The following augmented matrices are in {\rref}. The leading entries
  have been circled for emphasis. Note how all of the leading entries
  are equal to $1$, and they have zeros above them.
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{mymatrix}{rrrrr|r}
      \circled{1} & 2 & 0 & 5 & 0 & 3 \\
      0 & 0 & \circled{1} & 2 & 0 & 0 \\
      0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \circled{1} & 1 \\
      0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0
    \end{mymatrix},\quad\begin{mymatrix}{rrr|r}
      \circled{1} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
      0 & \circled{1} & 0 & 0 \\
      0 & 0 & \circled{1} & 0 \\
      0 & 0 & 0 & \circled{1} \\
      0 & 0 & 0 & 0
    \end{mymatrix}, \begin{mymatrix}{rrr|r}
      \circled{1} & 0 & 0 & 4 \\
      0 & \circled{1} & 0 & 3 \\
      0 & 0 & \circled{1} & 2
    \end{mymatrix}
  \end{equation*}
\end{example}

We can carry every augmented matrix to {\rref} by doing elementary row
operations.

\begin{algorithm}{Gauss-Jordan elimination}{gauss-jordan}
  This algorithm provides a method for using row operations to take a
  matrix to its {\rref}%
  \eindex{\rref!algorithm}%
  \index{Gauss-Jordan elimination}.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item First, use Gaussian elimination
    (Algorithm~\ref{algo:gaussian-elimination}) to reduce the matrix to
    {\ef}.
  \item Moving from right to left, consider each pivot entry. Without
    changing the row containing the pivot entry, or any rows below it,
    use row operations to create zeros in the column above the pivot
    entry. Finally, divide the row by its pivot entry, to make the
    pivot entry equal to $1$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{algorithm}

\begin{example}{Gauss-Jordan elimination}{gauss-jordan1}
  Solve the system of equations from
  Example~\ref{exa:system-with-one-solution} using Gauss-Jordan elimination.
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{array}{r@{~}c@{~}l}
      x+4y+3z &=& 11 \\
      2x+10y+7z &=& 27 \\
      x+y+2z &=& 5.
    \end{array}
  \end{equation*}
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
  In Example~\ref{exa:system-with-one-solution}, we had already reduced the
  system to {\ef}:
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{mymatrix}{rrr|r}
      \circled{1} & 4 & 3 & 11 \\
      0 & \circled{2} & 1 & 5 \\
      0 & 0 & \circled{1} & 3
    \end{mymatrix}.
  \end{equation*}
  We reduce it to {\rref} by performing the following row operations:
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{mymatrix}{rrr|r}
      \circled{1} & 4 & 3 & 11 \\
      0 & \circled{2} & 1 & 5 \\
      0 & 0 & \circled{1} & 3
    \end{mymatrix}
    \!\!\!\stackrel{R_2\rowop R_2-R_3}{\stackrel{R_1\rowop R_1-3R_3}{\roweq}}\!\!
    \begin{mymatrix}{rrr|r}
      \circled{1} & 4 & 0 & 2 \\
      0 & \circled{2} & 0 & 2 \\
      0 & 0 & \circled{1} & 3
    \end{mymatrix}
    \!\!\stackrel{R_1\rowop R_1-2R_2}{\roweq}\!\!
    \begin{mymatrix}{rrr|r}
      \circled{1} & 0 & 0 & -2 \\
      0 & \circled{2} & 0 & 2 \\
      0 & 0 & \circled{1} & 3
    \end{mymatrix}
    \!\!\stackrel{R_2\rowop \frac{1}{2}R_2}{\roweq}\!\!
    \begin{mymatrix}{rrr|r}
      \circled{1} & 0 & 0 & -2 \\
      0 & \circled{1} & 0 & 1 \\
      0 & 0 & \circled{1} & 3
    \end{mymatrix}\!\!.
  \end{equation*}
  The resulting matrix is in {\rref}. Note that the final system of
  equations is especially easy to solve, because the three equations
  are $x=-2$, $y=1$, and $z=3$. No back substitution is needed.
\end{solution}

\begin{example}{Gauss-Jordan elimination}{gauss-jordan2}
  Solve the system of equations from
  Example~\ref{exa:two-parameter-set-of-solution} using Gauss-Jordan
  elimination.
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{array}{r@{~}c@{~}l}
      x + 2y - 2z + 2w &=& 3 \\
      x + 2y - z  + 3w &=& 5 \\
      x + 2y - 3z + 1w &=& 1.
    \end{array}
  \end{equation*}
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
  In Example~\ref{exa:two-parameter-set-of-solution}, we had obtained the
  following {\ef}:
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{mymatrix}{rrrr|r}
      \circled{1} & 2 & -2 & 2 & 3 \\
      0 & 0 & \circled{1} & 1 & 2 \\
      0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0
    \end{mymatrix}.
  \end{equation*}
  We reduce this to {\rref} by performing the following additional
  step:
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{mymatrix}{rrrr|r}
      \circled{1} & 2 & -2 & 2 & 3 \\
      0 & 0 & \circled{1} & 1 & 2 \\
      0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0
    \end{mymatrix}
    \stackrel{R1\rowop R1+2R2}{\roweq}
    \begin{mymatrix}{rrrr|r}
      \circled{1} & 2 & 0 & 4 & 7 \\
      0 & 0 & \circled{1} & 1 & 2 \\
      0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0
    \end{mymatrix}.
  \end{equation*}
  The first equation states that $x=7-2y-4w$, and the second equation
  states that $z=2-w$. Using the free variables $y$ and $w$ as
  parameters, we obtain the following general solution:
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{array}{r@{~}c@{~}l}
      x &=& 7-2y-4w \\
      y &=& y \\
      z &=& 2-w \\
      w &=& w.
    \end{array}
  \end{equation*}
  Note that we did not really have to do back substitution; all we had
  to do is to shift parts of the equations to the right-hand side. If
  the solution looks strange, because it has equations like ``$y=y$''
  in it, keep in mind that this means that $y$ and $w$ are arbitrary
  numbers, i.e., parameters. We can replace $y$ and $w$ by parameters
  $s$ and $t$ on the right-hand side, as before:
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{array}{r@{~}c@{~}l}
      x &=& 7-2s-4t \\
      y &=& s \\
      z &=& 2-t \\
      w &=& t.
    \end{array}
  \end{equation*}
\end{solution}

\begin{discussion}{Which procedure is better?}{g-vs-gj}
  Which one is the better procedure to use, Gaussian elimination with
  back substitution, or Gauss-Jordan elimination? The answer is: it
  depends. In certain applications, it is not necessary to completely
  solve a system of equations. Sometimes it is sufficient just to figure
  out whether the system is consistent or inconsistent, or whether the
  solution is unique or not. In those situations, you already get the
  required information from the {\ef} and there is no need to do the
  additional steps to reduce the system to {\rref}. Also, in some
  situations, Gauss-Jordan elimination can introduce fractions into your
  augmented matrix, making the matrix more complicated to work with. In
  such cases, it may sometimes be easier to do back substitution. But in
  most cases, Gauss-Jordan elimination is simpler to do than back
  substitution, and therefore I recommend using the Gauss-Jordan method
  most of the time.
\end{discussion}

One situation where Gauss-Jordan elimination excels is when you have
to solve many systems of equations that all have the same coefficient
matrix.

\begin{example}{Multiple systems sharing the same left-hand side}{multiple-systems}
  Solve the following two systems of equations.
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{array}{r@{~}c@{~}l@{~}}
      x       +  z &=& 1 \\
      2x +  y + 3z &=& 2 \\
      3x + 2y + 5z &=& 4 \\
    \end{array}
    \quad\quad
    \begin{array}{r@{~}c@{~}l@{~}}
      x       +  z &=& 2 \\
      2x +  y + 3z &=& 5 \\
      3x + 2y + 5z &=& 8 \\
    \end{array}
  \end{equation*}
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
  We could certainly solve each system of equations separately. But
  since the left-hand sides are the same, we will perform exactly the
  same row operations on both systems. We can save some work by
  solving both systems together. Instead of a usual augmented matrix
  with only one constant vector, we create an augmented matrix
  containing both constant vectors at the same time.
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{mymatrix}{rrr|rr}
      1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 2 \\
      2 & 1 & 3 & 2 & 5 \\
      3 & 2 & 5 & 4 & 8 \\
    \end{mymatrix}
  \end{equation*}
  Then we row-reduce the coefficient matrix to {\rref} as usual. (We
  do not need to bother reducing the right-hand side to {\rref}).
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{mymatrix}{rrr|rr}
      1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 2 \\
      2 & 1 & 3 & 2 & 5 \\
      3 & 2 & 5 & 4 & 8 \\
    \end{mymatrix}
    \stackrel{R_2\rowop R_2-2R_1}{
      \stackrel{R_3\rowop R_3-3R_1}{\roweq}}
    \begin{mymatrix}{rrr|rr}
      1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 2 \\
      0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
      0 & 2 & 2 & 1 & 2 \\
    \end{mymatrix}
    \stackrel{R_3\rowop R_3-2R_2}{\roweq}
    \begin{mymatrix}{rrr|rr}
      1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 2 \\
      0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
      0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
    \end{mymatrix}.
  \end{equation*}
  We see that the first system is inconsistent, because it contains a
  row of the form $\mat{0~0~0~|~1}$. The second system is consistent,
  and we get the general solution $z=t$, $y=1-t$, $x=2-t$.
\end{solution}
